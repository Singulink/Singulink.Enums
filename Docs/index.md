# Singulink Enums

## Overview

**Singulink Enums** is a tiny (~30KB), highly optimized library with full AOT support that provides generic operations and extension methods for enumeration types. It contains a comprehensive set of the most common enumeration "must haves" that are missing from the .NET runtime. The effect on runtime memory footprint has been pushed to the bare minimum while still supporting common scenarios in the most efficient way possible.

This package is part of our **Singulink Libraries** collection. Visit https://github.com/Singulink to see our full list of publicly available libraries and other open-source projects.
